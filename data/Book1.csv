"What is the difference between environmental science and environmental engineering? Computer Science is a branch of Computer Science and Information Technology. The goal of the Computer Science program is to train high-quality engineers who are able to design, build and develop software systems that meet national and international needs. Engineers graduating with a degree in Computer Science are also equipped with the necessary knowledge to continue on to master's and doctoral studies in the field of Computers and Information Technology."
